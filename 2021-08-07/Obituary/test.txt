As he went he removed the fan leaves from each plant and caressed the small green flowers, the resin glands. On his palm they left a thin layer, clear at first, then thickening and darkening until he could press the sticky brown mass with his thumb, and snap it off. He did not hurry. This was a communion between man and plant, a divine thing. The terpenes the flowers released were so intense that they almost overwhelmed him; his body seemed to float in the very essence of the valley.

His head was full of Marco Polo, Lawrence of Arabia and wild, tripping tales of survival in hard places.

In America’s best cannabis country, the Emerald Triangle of northern California, the rolling hills produced dozens of strains.

The lids were stamped, in the manner of Cognac, with V.S.O.P., for Very Special Olde Press.
