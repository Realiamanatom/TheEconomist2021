It has a large arm fitted with suction cups which can pick up several boxes at a time and then feed them onto a conveyor belt, or knock down a wall of boxes and sweep them onto the conveyor. An individual human worker can unload between 600 and 1,200 boxes an hour. Honeywell hopes that, once its robot is perfected, a single crew chief will be able to supervise the simultaneous unloading of three or four lorries, each at rates of up to 1,500 boxes an hour.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Thomas Evans, chief technology officer of Honeywell’s robotics operation, says the robot does not need to be as precise as the pick-and-place robots that work on assembly lines. But it is still a challenge for it to distinguish between individual boxes and to recognise and identify anomalous objects such as loose pallets and the pallet jacks used to move stacked pallets around. At the moment, therefore, it works best with boxes of uniform size and shape.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Changing that will need a lot of training, which, in turn, means designing and assembling a variety of dummy loads inside a variety of vehicles. This is both time-consuming and labour-intensive. Dr Evans says his team can put together about four such test loads a day. Ideally, that number would be nearer 100—but running tests at this scale would be expensive. Digital simulations can help. They are, though, Dr Evans says, no substitute for the real thing. He is therefore negotiating with one of the potential customers for the robot, a company that already handles this volume of business, to do the training there.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"In Massachusetts, a firm called Boston Dynamics takes a different approach from Honeywell’s. Boston Dynamics is famous in the wider world for an acrobatic humanoid robot called Atlas, and for Spot, a robot that resembles a dog and is now on sale as a device for monitoring what is happening in factories and other large spaces.

It sports a single arm festooned with sensors and a suction gripper able to handle boxes weighing up to about 25kg. Unlike Honeywell’s system, Stretch can already manage the trick of examining a wall of boxes, working out their sizes and shapes, and choosing which to pick up first. It is, though, slower. The aim is that it will be able to handle 800 cases an hour.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"A third contender, Dill, is made by the Pickle Robot Company, also based in Massachusetts. Andrew Meyer, Pickle’s boss, believes Dill has an edge over the competition because Pickle’s engineers have focused on the robot’s ability to handle messy trailers with irregular loads. This is not just a matter of machine vision and an ability to work out where boxes are, but also of understanding the laws of physics, and therefore how particular objects will behave.
